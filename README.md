# View-Source Demo

## Overview

This is a **Next.js**(app router) typescript project styled with **Tailwind CSS**. The purpose of this project is to replicate the provided Figma design of the home page with clean, reusable, and well-structured code.

This README file will demonstrate the process and steps that will be taken to complete the project. Please note that while these are the intended steps for projects like this, I may not be able to complete all of them within the scope of this demo.

## Why the Specs

Using a modern framework like Next.js and TypeScript makes the project more versatile and manageable for future changes. It also offers a better developer experience by providing type safety, autocompletion, and easier debugging.

## Steps

### Step 1: Organize Images, Fonts and Colors

- Get images, font families, and theme colors from the given file.
- Set the fonts and colors to tailwind configs for consistent usage across the project.

### Step 2: Identify Common Components

- Review the Figma design for reusable components.
- Create reusable React components for these parts and use the _atomic design_ system to manage them.

### Step 3: Layout Setup

- Modify the default **layout** provided by Next.js to match the design specifications.

### Step 4: Implement Each Sections

- Implement sections of the page one by one, make them responsive **from small devices to larger ones.**

### Step 5: Responsiveness and Details

- Ensure the website is fully responsive by screen sizes.
- Add the necessary animations.
- Confirm the styles match the design specifications.

### Step 6: Functionality (If)

- Use Formik to handle forms, and Yup for validations.
- CMS integration, etc...

### Step 7: Cleanups (If)

- Revalidate the parts marked with _FIXME:_, _TODO:_, or _TEMP:_ keywords (they are special keywords in my editor). If they're finished, delete the annotations.
- Check if there are any unnecessary **console.log()** statements that should be removed.
- Compress images.
